# CutGrassGrowsFlowers

Adds an extra pass during `WorldManager.nextDayChanges` so that flowers will grow overnight on cut grass with two chances per tile per night.

This lets you mow sections of grass to use them as wildflower farms.

Works *very* well in Spring.

## Installation

1. Install BepInEx 6.0.0-pre1
2. Extract `CutGrassGrowsFlowers.dll` to `.\Dinkum\BepInEx\plugins`
